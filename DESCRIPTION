Package: UnsupRF
Title: Unsupervised Random Forest Clustering
Version: 1.0
Author: Che Ngufor
Maintainer: Che Ngufor <Ngufor.Che@mayo.edu>
Description: Cluster data using randomForest proximities. A Random forest
    classifier is trained to predict the data labeled as class "True.Data" and
    a synthetic data labeled as class "Synthetic.Data". The synthetic data is
    generated by random sampling from the emperical distribution of the true data or
    by permuting true data. The proximities between observations in the true data is
    converted to a dissimilarity matrix and can be used by any clustering algorithm
    that accepts a dissimilarity matrix. Several routines for cluster validation and determination 
    of optimal number of clusters are also implemented.
