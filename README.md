# UnsupRF
Unsupervised Random Forest Clustering

Cluster data using randomForest proximities. A Random forest
classifier is trained to predict the data labeled as class "True.Data" and
a synthetic data labeled as class "Synthetic.Data". The synthetic data is
generated by random sampling from the emperical distribution of the true data or
by permuting true data. The proximities between observations in the true data is
converted to a dissimilarity matrix and can be used by any clustering algorithm
that accepts a dissimilarity matrix. Several routines for cluster validation and determination 
of optimal number of clusters are also implemented.
